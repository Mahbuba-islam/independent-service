                 is to achieve goals, you have set. I have set certain goals i would like to achieve my lifetime.
                , The most important goal i want to achieve in my life is to be a professional programmer. 
                But, this journey is not easy for me. Although i have found a great course to be a programmer.
                But every day i face so much problem to finish classes. But i didn't give up and i promise to me that in future also
                i won't give up. I always believe in my-self that if i work hard Oneday i will be a great programmer InSha-Allah
                I will always work-hard to fulfill my dream no matter what happen in my life.</p>
